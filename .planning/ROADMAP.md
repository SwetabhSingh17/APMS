# Roadmap: IntegralProjectHub (APMS)

## Overview

This roadmap defines the next evolution cycle of the Integral University Academic Project Management System (APMS). Starting from the solid foundation of v2.0.1, it hardens data integrity during system backups and restores, implements server-side registration gates and input sanitization, replaces mock dashboard feeds with real audit events, and decouples Express route handlers into domain services.

## Completed Milestones

- [v2.1.0: Multi-Word Search & UI/UX Enhancements](milestones/v2.1.0-ROADMAP.md) (2 phases, 4 plans completed 2026-10-06)

## Active Phases (Milestone v2.2.0)

- [x] **Phase 1: IU-APMP Renaming, A-Z Backup, Topological Restore & Multi-Page Excel Export** - Complete 8-table archive export, safe transactional restore, 8-sheet university Excel reporting, and IU-APMP project rebranding (login page unchanged)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Security Hardening & Registration Controls** - Enforce server-side registration locks and input sanitization on user submissions
- [ ] **Phase 3: Live Activity & Audit Trail** - Replace mock activity feeds with persistent departmental audit event streams
- [ ] **Phase 4: Architecture Modularity & Clean Services** - Decouple route handlers into domain services and clean up dead server instances

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: IU-APMP Renaming, A-Z Backup, Topological Restore & Multi-Page Excel Export

**Goal**: Deliver a 100% complete A-Z backup & restore system with foreign key dependency order, an official 8-sheet university Excel export, and standardize portal branding as IU-APMP (leaving login page untouched) with zero production data loss.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: RENAME-01, BACKUP-01, BACKUP-02, BACKUP-03, BACKUP-04, EXCEL-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Project rebranded as IU-APMP (Integral University Academic Project Management Portal) across navigation, sidebar, titles, and metadata while strictly preserving `auth-page.tsx` untouched.
  2. Backup & Export button generates a complete archive (zip/folder) containing all 8 tables (`student_groups`, `users`, `student_group_members`, `project_topics`, `student_projects`, `project_assessments`, `project_milestones`, `notifications`), manifest with counts, and SQL insert dump, saving a copy in `database/backups/`.
  3. Import & Restore reconstructs the portal with exact fidelity in topological order (`groups` → `users` → `members` → `topics` → `projects` → `assessments` → `milestones` → `notifications`) inside an atomic transaction with automated pre-restore safety snapshot.
  4. PostgreSQL sequence counters are safely aligned past imported maximum IDs across all tables.
  5. Multi-Page Excel Export generates an official single `.xlsx` workbook containing 8 dedicated worksheets for departmental and university administrative reporting.
  6. All operations maintain 100% backward compatibility and zero disruption to the active running production database.

**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: A-Z Complete Portal Backup Engine & Server Archive Packaging
- [x] 01-02: High-Fidelity Topological Restore Engine with Atomic Transaction & Pre-Restore Snapshot
- [x] 01-03: Multi-Sheet University Excel Report Generator & Project Renaming to IU-APMP
- [x] 01-04: System Management UI Console Upgrade & Non-Destructive Test Suite

### Phase 2: Security Hardening & Registration Controls

**Goal**: Close registration bypass vectors and sanitize user text fields against XSS.
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: SEC-01, SEC-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `POST /api/register` checks server-side registration open flag and returns 403 when registration is closed.
  2. User text inputs in topic proposals and feedback are sanitized before storage in PostgreSQL.

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: Add server-side registration toggle middleware/check in `server/routes/auth.ts`
- [ ] 02-02: Implement text sanitization helper and integrate into topic and review endpoints

### Phase 3: Live Activity & Audit Trail

**Goal**: Deliver a transparent live audit and activity feed on the dashboard.
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: AUDIT-01, AUDIT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `GET /api/activities` queries real recent records from PostgreSQL.
  2. Coordinators and Admins see live timestamped actions (topic approvals, supervisor allotments, default password resets).

**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: Implement dynamic activity aggregator in `server/routes/stats.ts`

### Phase 4: Architecture Modularity & Clean Services

**Goal**: Decouple Express route handlers into domain services following SOLID principles.
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: ARCH-01, ARCH-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Route handlers in `server/routes/` delegate complex business logic to dedicated services.
  2. Redundant `createServer(app)` call removed from `server/routes/index.ts`.

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: Remove dead HTTP server instance in `server/routes/index.ts`
- [ ] 04-02: Extract topic and group business logic into modular service layers
